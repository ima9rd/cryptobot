This is a bot that gathers cryptocurreny trade information from Binance, along with sentiment analysis from Twitter (other sources can be added as well - just follow the schema in the sentiment analysis table) for use in predictive modeling and machine learning applications.

To use this bot, install dependencies (python-binance, pymssql, textblob, tweepy, and possibly others), then setup all credentials as outlined in cred.py. Run bot.py to begin gathering data.

Note: I never used this for any machine learning or predictive modeling, so don't expect that in a future commit from me!
